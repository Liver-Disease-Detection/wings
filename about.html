            <h2>What is Liver Disease?</h2>
            <p>Liver disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the liver's structure and function. It can be caused by various factors, including viral infections, alcohol abuse, obesity, and more. Liver diseases can be mild or severe and may lead
                to serious health complications if left untreated.</p>

            <h2>Prediction Methodology</h2>
            <p>Our liver disease prediction model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle choices to assess an individual's risk of developing liver disease. The model is based on extensive
                research and data analysis to provide accurate predictions.</p>
